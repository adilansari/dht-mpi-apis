Ongoing code modifications:

* Take tools from mpi_tools that do not need MPI and move them to
  a new module "tools"

* Remove mpi_tools references from code that does not need them

* Simplify header files, move more definitions into the C files
  that need them

* Migrate away from requiring D=1 for test output
